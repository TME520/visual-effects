Back in 2007/2008 I had some fun with BlitzMax, a programming language dedicated to games. I remember taking my super neat Asus U1-1P051E ultra-portable laptop with me in the parisian subway while commuting to the office and getting some Photoshop / coding work done in that crowded space. That work was showcased at the City Library of Melbourne in Australia during the year 2009 thanks to [Sean Rodrigo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/google-tilt-brush-artist/).
